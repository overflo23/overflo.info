# Generate scaled images from raw files:

All images in `images/projects/` are automatically generated from `images_raw/projects` with

    ./generate-thumbnails.sh

You need to have ImageMagick installed for the `mogify` command. Install on OSX with `brew install imagemagick`

After generating, you might still want to run the images through ImageOptim.
