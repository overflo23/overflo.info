# Adding and updating images

Source images should have 6:4 aspect ratio, with at least 1024px horizontally.

All images in `images/projects/` are automatically generated from `images_raw/projects` with

    ./generate-thumbnails.sh

You need to have ImageMagick installed for the `mogify` command. Install on OSX with `brew install imagemagick`

If you want to add or update one specific image only, update it in the `images_raw` folder and then just add the
filename as argument to update only that one:

    ./generate-thumbnails.sh <filename>

# Randomize project order

    pip3 install beautifulsoup4
    ./randomize-projects.py

This will generate a file called `index-random.html`, which is copied from `index.html` only with randomized projects.
